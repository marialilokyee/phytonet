# Phytonet - the internet of water
![PhytoNet Cover](https://github.com/marialilokyee/phytonet/blob/main/Photos/sensing%20organ-smaller.png)

We are a group of biodesigners, biochemist, plant biologist and makers building a regenerative internet powered by algae in our waterways.

### What is Phytonet?
Phytonet is a citizen science initiative tackling the twin challenges of renewable energy demand and water pollution.

We invite communities, researchers, makers, artists, and eco-minded citizens to co-create and deploy Biophotovoltaic (BPV) systems — living devices powered by photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae and cyanobacteria.

These systems go beyond generating clean, low-power bioelectricity:

🌿 Capture carbon
📡 Act as real-time environmental sensors
♻ Purify wastewater
By combining open-source electronics, ecological enrichment, and collaborative data sharing, Phytonet empowers people to:

- Monitor local waterways
- Advocate for sustainable policy change
- Reconnect with the natural systems that sustain life

### 🌏 Our Missions
Build a global network of water-quality IoT devices powered by locally generated bioenergy
Foster collaboration between citizens, researchers, and makers to advance regenerative energy solutions
Use environmental data—such as water quality and carbon capture rates—to influence policy and enable informed decision-making
Inspire BPV-derived projects in new applications and environments — from bioremediation and carbon removal to remote environmental monitoring in both marine and freshwater ecosystems

**🔍 Research Questions**

1️⃣ Design & Performance

- How can we create low-cost, accessible BPV systems and test their power generation, carbon capture performance, and durability in diverse environments—such as household kitchen wastewater, canals and rivers, and urban gardens?

2️⃣ Human–Nature Engagement

- How can photosynthesis-powered environmental sensors foster public engagement in environmental monitoring and influence people’s behaviour towards becoming Ecological Citizens?

3️⃣ Shaping the Future of BPV

- How can adopting citizen science from the early research stage influence the development, adoption, and potential applications of BPV technology?
